National-ID-Card-Recognition-using-OCR:
In this Capstone project, you will be working on National ID Card Recognition using OCR. You will use Tesseract OCR, an open-source OCR engine, to recognize the text on the ID card images. Additionally, you will use OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, to preprocess the images before passing them to the OCR engine. This project will give you hands-on experience with computer vision and OCR, which are increasingly important areas in the field of artificial intelligence. Hint: Use Tesseract for OCR and Find Contours to wrap the image. Target: Make this code generic enough and upload sample images to test it. Expected : upload random national id card , output :all data in structured pandas format.
